# **Fetchify** - is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser, ## *alternative* of `Axios` and lighter than Axios.

## It can run in the browser and node.js with the same codebase. On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequest.

### Supports most of the http requests like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. Configure Request and Response Interceptors.
